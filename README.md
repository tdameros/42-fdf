# 42 FDF Project

This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object
in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For
example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a
prerequisite condition to its conquest.

As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic
activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution, and as
a result, be better prepared.

_FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe
model’._

The program represent the model in isometric projection.
